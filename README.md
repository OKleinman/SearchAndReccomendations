# SearchAndRecommendations
Dynamic database-driven website accessible to a Global Politics teacher and his students with two separate account types for students and teachers. Both accounts can add case studies to the system with a high degree of customization and specificity, but the teacher account type has editing and deleting privileges on all case studies. Teachers and students can add case studies to the system with fields for a description, optional video, location, date, key concepts, levels of analysis, unit, and other factors. They can also search and view the case studies based on any one of these factors, as well as by the actual name of the case study. The built-in case study recommendation page further helps users find useful case studies based on their recent viewing. All functions of the website are built with accessibility and accuracy in mind, and the remote-hosted website would allow for the scalability and security of the system. This system is created around the input requirements of the case student, unlike the spreadsheet. This allows for speed of access with the search functions, ease of navigation with simple displays, and ease of input with appropriate fields.
